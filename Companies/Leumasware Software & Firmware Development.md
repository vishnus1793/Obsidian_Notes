## üîß Core Technical Skills

### 1. Embedded C / C++
- Master low-level memory management.
- Learn pointers, bitwise operations, struct packing.
- Practice coding for microcontrollers like Arduino, STM32.
- **Focus**: Real-time constraints, interrupt handling.

### 2. Microcontrollers & Embedded Systems
- Understand microcontroller architecture (registers, memory-mapped I/O).
- Work with platforms:
  - Arduino
  - Raspberry Pi
  - ESP32
- Write firmware to control sensors, motors, etc.

### 3. Linux System Programming
- Key topics:
  - Process management (`fork`, `exec`)
  - File I/O (`open`, `read`, `write`)
  - Multithreading (`pthreads`)
  - Inter-Process Communication (pipes, shared memory)
- Tools: `gdb`, `valgrind`, `strace`

### 4. Operating Systems Concepts
- Concepts to learn:
  - Scheduling
  - Memory management
  - System calls
  - Interrupts
- üìò Recommended Book: *Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces*

### 5. Version Control & Build Tools
- Git (commit, branch, merge)
- Makefiles, CMake
- Debugging tools: `gdb`, `valgrind`
- Intro to embedded build systems like Yocto (bonus)
