# ⏱️ Time and Speed – Aptitude Cheat Sheet

---

## 🔹 Core Formulas
- **Speed = Distance / Time**
- **Time = Distance / Speed**
- **Distance = Speed × Time**

---

## 🔹 Units Conversion
- **1 km = 1000 m**, **1 hour = 3600 sec**
- **km/hr to m/s** → `multiply by (5/18)`
- **m/s to km/hr** → `multiply by (18/5)`

---

## 🔹 Relative Speed
- **Same direction** → `Relative Speed = |S1 − S2|`
- **Opposite direction** → `Relative Speed = S1 + S2`

Use relative speed when:
- Two bodies move towards/away from each other
- Overtaking or crossing each other

---

## 🔹 Time to Cross
1. **Train crosses a pole / standing object**:  
   `Time = Length of train / Speed`

2. **Train crosses a platform / bridge**:  
   `Time = (Length of train + Length of platform) / Speed`

3. **Two trains cross each other (lengths L1 and L2)**:  
   `Time = (L1 + L2) / Relative Speed`

---

## 🔹 Average Speed
- **If distances are equal**:  
  `Avg Speed = 2ab / (a + b)`

- **If times are equal**:  
  `Avg Speed = (a + b) / 2`

- **General case**:  
  `Avg Speed = Total Distance / Total Time`

---

## 🔹 Boats and Streams
- **Downstream speed** = `Boat speed + Stream speed`
- **Upstream speed** = `Boat speed − Stream speed`

- **Speed of boat in still water** = `(Downstream + Upstream) / 2`  
- **Speed of stream** = `(Downstream − Upstream) / 2`

---

## 🔹 Chasing & Overtaking
If A is behind B by **d** meters, and speeds are `Sa > Sb`:  
`Time to catch = d / (Sa − Sb)`

---

## 🔹 Circular Tracks
- **Opposite directions**:  
  `Time to meet = Track Length / (S1 + S2)`

- **Same direction**:  
  `Time to meet = Track Length / |S1 − S2|`

---

## 🔹 Meeting Points
If two objects start at the same time, from A and B towards each other:  
Let them meet after `t` hours:  
`(Speed of A × t) + (Speed of B × t) = Distance between A and B`

---

## 🔹 Problem Patterns
- **Man walking with/against a current/wind** → Boats & Streams
- **Train crossing pole/bridge/person** → Use length
- **Two vehicles approaching or departing** → Relative speed
- **Average speed trap** → Use formula, not average of speeds
- **Meeting at a point problem** → Use `Time = Distance / Speed` logic for both

---

## 🔹 Shortcuts
- **Catch-up time** = `Lead / Difference in speed`
- **When start times differ**: Use LCM of time/distance to sync

---

## 🔹 Must-Know Ratios
- If time is reduced by **x%**, speed is increased by:  
  `[x / (100 − x)] × 100%`

- If speed is increased by **x%**, time is decreased by:  
  `[x / (100 + x)] × 100%`

---

## 🔹 Common Traps
- Don’t forget **unit conversion**
- Don’t average speeds unless **time is constant**
- Train/platform problems use **train + object length**
- Always consider **direction** in relative speed
