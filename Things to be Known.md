Software development typically follows these **stages of production**:

1. **Pre-Alpha** â€“ Initial development with incomplete features, mostly internal testing.
2. **Alpha** â€“ Basic functionality implemented; internal or limited external testing begins.
3. **Beta** â€“ Feature-complete but with potential bugs; open or closed testing for users.
4. **Release Candidate (RC)** â€“ Final version before official launch; mostly bug fixes.
5. **Stable / Production** â€“ Official release for the public, fully tested and supported.
6. **Maintenance / Updates** â€“ Regular patches, security updates, and feature improvements.

Beeper is currently in the **Beta** stage, meaning it is mostly functional but still being tested and improved before full public release. ðŸš€

## Removing the Last Commit in GitHub

### **1. Remove Last Commit Locally and Push the Change**
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push origin --force
```
This completely removes the last commit from your local and remote repository.

---

### **2. Keep Changes but Remove Commit**
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
git push origin --force
```
This removes the commit but keeps the changes in your working directory.

---

### **3. Revert the Last Commit (Recommended for Shared Repositories)**
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin
```
This creates a new commit that undoes the changes without rewriting history.

---

**Note:** Be cautious when using `git push --force`, especially in a shared repository, as it rewrites history and can affect others working on the same branch.
