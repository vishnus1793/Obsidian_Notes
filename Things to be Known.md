Software development typically follows these **stages of production**:

1. **Pre-Alpha** â€“ Initial development with incomplete features, mostly internal testing.
2. **Alpha** â€“ Basic functionality implemented; internal or limited external testing begins.
3. **Beta** â€“ Feature-complete but with potential bugs; open or closed testing for users.
4. **Release Candidate (RC)** â€“ Final version before official launch; mostly bug fixes.
5. **Stable / Production** â€“ Official release for the public, fully tested and supported.
6. **Maintenance / Updates** â€“ Regular patches, security updates, and feature improvements.

Beeper is currently in the **Beta** stage, meaning it is mostly functional but still being tested and improved before full public release. ðŸš€
