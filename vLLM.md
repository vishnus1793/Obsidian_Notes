# vLLM: The Ultimate Guide (No Fluff, Pure Wisdom)

## 🔹 What is vLLM?

**vLLM (virtual LLM)** is a **fast, memory-efficient, and high-throughput inference engine** for large language models. Built by UC Berkeley and collaborators. Optimized for serving LLMs in production.

---

## 🔹 Key Features

- **PagedAttention**
  - Decouples KV cache from prompt length.
  - Eliminates memory fragmentation.
  - Enables high-efficiency parallel requests.

- **Continuous Batching**
  - Streams new requests mid-inference.
  - No padding or artificial delays.
  - Fully utilizes GPU compute.

- **Multi-model Serving**
  - Supports hot-swapping and simultaneous multiple models.
  - Lazily loads model weights.

- **OpenAI-Compatible API**
  - Implements `/v1/completions` and `/v1/chat/completions`.
  - Drop-in replacement for OpenAI API.

## 🔹 Architecture Overview

- **Worker**: Hosts models, runs forward passes.
- **Scheduler**: Dynamically batches tokens for max throughput.
- **KV Cache Manager**: Handles PagedAttention memory layout.
- **Swapper**: Swaps inactive KV cache to handle long sessions efficiently.
